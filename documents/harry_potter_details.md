## Magical Objects & Concepts

### Horcruxes

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Who killed Albus Dumbledore?
Severus Snape killed Albus Dumbledore on June 30, 1997, atop the Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts. This act was performed on Dumbledore’s own orders to protect Draco Malfoy’s soul and maintain Snape’s cover as a loyal Death Eater.

### Who killed Sirius Black?
Bellatrix Lestrange killed Sirius Black during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries on June 18, 1996. Sirius fell through a veiled arch in the Death Chamber after being hit by Bellatrix’s spell.

### What is a Horcrux?
A Horcrux is an object in which a dark wizard or witch has hidden a fragment of their soul. The purpose is to achieve immortality; as long as the Horcrux remains intact, the individual cannot truly die. Voldemort created six intentional Horcruxes and inadvertently created a seventh in Harry Potter.

### Who created the Deathly Hallows?
According to “The Tale of the Three Brothers” (from Beedle the Bard), Death personified created the Deathly Hallows. In reality, the Elder Wand was crafted by Death’s brother Antioch Peverell, the Resurrection Stone was originally in the Peverell family (turned into the Ring), and the Invisibility Cloak was passed down to Ignotus Peverell. 

### Who killed Bellatrix Lestrange?
Molly Weasley killed Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of Hogwarts on May 2, 1998. Bellatrix was about to curse Ginny Weasley when Molly dueled her and hit the Killing Curse, which Molly managed to deflect first.

### What is the significance of the Horcrux in Harry’s mind?
Unintentionally, Harry became a Horcrux when Voldemort’s Killing Curse rebounded in 1981. The connection meant Harry and Voldemort shared a mental link: Harry could see into Voldemort’s mind, speak Parseltongue, and occasionally witness Voldemort’s thoughts and emotions. This connection played a crucial role in finding and destroying the Horcrux within Harry.

### Who is the Half-Blood Prince?
Severus Snape is the Half-Blood Prince. The nickname refers to his mixed blood status (mother was a witch, father a Muggle) and his mastery of potions and spell invention, as recorded in his annotated Potions textbook discovered by Harry during their sixth year.

### Why did Dumbledore want Snape to kill him?
Dumbledore asked Snape to kill him to ensure several outcomes: 
1. Spare Draco Malfoy’s soul from murder (Draco had been ordered to kill Dumbledore by Voldemort).  
2. Reinforce Voldemort’s trust in Snape as a loyal Death Eater, allowing Snape to continue gathering intelligence.  
3. Prevent the Elder Wand’s power from passing to Voldemort (Snape would be its master after Dumbledore’s death, but ultimately Draco was disarmed by Harry, making Harry the master).

### How many Death Eaters were there?
The exact number is not specified, but Death Eaters included notable figures such as Bellatrix Lestrange, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, Peter Pettigrew, Barty Crouch Jr., Fenrir Greyback (affiliate), Antonin Dolohov, and many others. Their ranks fluctuated as some deserted, were imprisoned, or died.

### Who killed Nagini?
Neville Longbottom killed Nagini, Voldemort’s snake and final Horcrux, with the sword of Gryffindor during the Battle of Hogwarts.

### What happened to Peter Pettigrew?
Peter Pettigrew escaped Wormtail form during the Battle of Hogwarts after trying (and failing) to stop Harry at the Malfoy Manor. His silver hand, given to him by Voldemort, strangled him as punishment for his repeated failures.

### Who is the true master of the Elder Wand?
Harry Potter ultimately becomes the true master of the Elder Wand. Although Draco Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore before Snape’s attack, transferring the wand’s allegiance to Draco, Harry later disarms Draco at Malfoy Manor, inadvertently becoming the wand’s rightful owner.
